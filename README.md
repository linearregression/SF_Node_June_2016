# SF_Node_Talk
Example web app using MeAN Stack to showcase some NPM Modules. These are modules that I like and think you should try.

# What
Write an app that uses Passport to connect with Google. 

- Express is the web framework, and will be compared with lite-server as a devdependency. 

- Morgan is the logger. 

- Mongoose will help create and type check the database schema. 

- Bcrypt for password hashing. 

- Node_acl for data authorization on user changes to events after being pulled into the web app. 

- Moment-timezone for time methods that can be helpful.

- Helmet for http security changes.

- Passport Website login.
